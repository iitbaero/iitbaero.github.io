Grad School Profiles is a collection of the profiles of final year graduating students and recent alumni of the Department of Aerospace Engineering who are pursuing higher studies at universities all across the globe in various fields of research. This database is meant to primarily assist penultimate year students who are interested to pursue research after their graduation, but will also be  useful to junior batches as well. Through this database, you can get a fair idea of the profile/experience expected by different universities in different areas of research and how you can develop your own profiles in your early years of undergrad by taking up relevant courses/projects in the institute. I have also provided links to useful resources, webpages and blogs which will answer most of your questions. Please feel free to contact any of the seniors in case you have more doubts (contact details are provided at their respective webpages).

I wish that this database will help you navigate through the various steps of your grad school application and make informed choices about your future. A huge shoutout to all the seniors who took out time from their schedule and helped build this database!
