#### Any advice/tips for juniors who are interested in a similar field and are planning to go for Higher Studies?
Be cautious about applying for Aerospace fields, esp. if you're from outside the department. Aerospace is a field with a lot of national value due to its links to defense and the military, and it is super tough to get a good admit if you're from another department. Try building good ties with the department right from insti itself.
