**The following links to blogs and drive folders will be helpful to students applying to grad school, irrespective of how far along they are in their application process (covers everything from GRE/TOEFL to writing essays and preparing LoRs). Some of the links are provided by seniors and the rest are collated from different insti websites. Hope this helps!**
