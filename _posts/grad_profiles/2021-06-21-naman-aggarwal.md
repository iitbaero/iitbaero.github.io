#### Any advice/tips for juniors who are interested in a similar field and are planning to go for Higher Studies?
Focus on doing quality work. Focus more on the quality of your work rather than being in a rush to publish. Displaying initiative and independent thinking is a win-win for a PhD admit and also for the coming years, therefore take ownership of your projects and think about where YOU want to take your problem statement, obviously in consultation with your advisor.

Getting an admit is not magic. People overcomplicate straight-forward things. Have strong reasons for applying to the program you're applying in, be it a Masters or a PhD, and your actions and preparation will naturally reflect your desire, hence increasing your probability of getting an admit.
