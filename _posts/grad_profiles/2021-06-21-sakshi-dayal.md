#### Any advice/tips for juniors who are interested in a similar field and are planning to go for Higher Studies?
"Don't apply to unnecessarily safe universities you won't join ever. 
Make sure you can afford the tuition fee and living expenses at the universities you apply, decide MS vs PhD accordingly. 
Keep track of university specific scholarships, they have deadlines much before application deadlines. 
Understand the career placement scenario of the place for international candidates before applying, such as Europe, Japan, Singapore, Australia etc. 
Keep a good mix of subjects you are good at and the ones you love when deciding which department to apply. 
While choosing PhD, advisor is of utmost importance, ask around about him/her before accepting any offer. 
Don't mention just one professor in your SoP and get your SoP reviewed from multiple seniors very well in advance."
