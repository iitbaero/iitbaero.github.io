<br>
Advisors: Srikant Sukumar, Hemendra Arya

#### What all courses did you take in Insti which you think fostered your interest in your current research area and are relevant to your field? Please mention the semester in which you took the course as well.
* SC301 - 5
* SC618 - 6
* CL653 - 7
* SC624 - 6
* SC629 - 7
* SC617 - 7 
* CL686 - 8
* SC607 - 8

#### What were the Peaks in your profile which you think helped you in getting an admit? (Publication(s), Department Rank, etc.)
Project work, good LORs (Probably), having decent grades in relevant courses. These things mattered as the programs to which I had applied are research-focused. 

#### Please mention the sources for your Letters of Recommendation (BTP/DDP Guide, Internship guide, Course Instructor, etc.)
* Prof. Srikant Sukumar
* Hemendra Arya
* Varun Bhalerao

#### Any advice/tips for juniors who are interested in a similar field and are planning to go for Higher Studies?
For the field of controls, if someone is interested in research, maths is a must. Mathematics lies at the heart of dynamics, control and estimation. The other part is implementation; this includes realizing the mathematical algorithms using simulations or actual real systems (e.g. robot). It helps in the grad applications if somebody has developed some expertise in either mathematics or implementation. Expertise in the implementation will include but is not limited to proficiency in using Matlab, Python, RPi, ROS, Gazebo, etc. As this field is quite broad, I would suggest taking courses in different domains of control (e.g. deterministic vs stochastic systems) in the B.Tech and see what interests you. Also, the schools vary a lot in terms of their expertise in the various control domains. Evaluate these things carefully, moreover talk to the project guide as it helps a lot in making these decisions. The general rule of thumb: Start the application process early (GRE, LORs, sorting universities), be reasonably ambitious.
