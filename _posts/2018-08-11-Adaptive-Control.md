**Course Instructor:** Prof. Srikant Sukumar

**Course Difficulty:** Difficult

**Time Commitment Required:** High

**Grading:** Very Strict

**Attendance Policy:** No DX enforced but attendance contributes to grade

**Pre-Requisites:** Depending on instructor, it might be required for the student interested in taking this course to have done control theory courses - I.e. SC201, SC 202; SC 301 or AE 308 or both

**This Course has:** Assignment(s), Project(s), This courses does not have any quizzes or exams

**Topics Covered in the Course:**
Stability of time-varying systems  Barbalats Lemma. * Overview of Lyapunov Stability Theory. * Classical Adaptive Control Theory  Certainty Equivalence * Filter Construction and Non-Certainty Equivalence Adaptive Control * Advanced topics include parameter projection and robustness modifications in adaptive control.

**Weightage:**
Project; 1, 50%
Assignments,  4, 45%
Class Participation, 5%

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures are very informative and the professor makes them very interesting. The whole courses is tackled through the usage of one example problem after the other with the problem difficulty getting tougher as you progress into the courses. The lectures are usually taken on the board and rarely with slides. Attending the lectures and understanding the content should be good enough to be able to complete the assignments.

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
The assignments are gruellingly difficult as you progress down the course. Lots of programming is required (Matlab knowledge is sufficient). There is one final project with requires you to find some recent paper in adaptive control and implement the same and/or improve on it while providing sufficient evidence of mathematical rigor and successful programming results.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
This course has no exams

**Other Remarks:**
This course is a must-do for anyone interested in taking a step or continuing in systems and control engineering research. The lack of exams and focus on assignments in this courses is because it is a research oriented course and not one that seeks to just provide you with information.

**References used in this course:**
There is no required text for the course and adequate notes will be provided. However, additional material and problems might be derived from the following sources: P. Ioannou and J. Sun, Robust Adaptive Control, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996. S. Sastry and M. Bodson, Adaptive Control: Stability, Convergence and Robustness, Upper Saddle River, NJ, Prentice Hall, 1989 H. K. Khalil, Nonlinear Systems, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002.

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking this course?:**
Strongly recommended
