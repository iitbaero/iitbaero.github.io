# Thin-Walled Beam Cross-Sectional Analysis using Mechanics of Structure Genome
### APOORV SOM

**Guides**: Prof. Abhijit Gogulapati & Prof. PJ Guruprasad

**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 7400401575

---

**Project type**: BTP

**Motivation to pursue project**: I am interested in research in the field of Aerospace Structures, especially beam & plate-like structures. Such structures are mainly used to design rotor blades, turbine blades, tubes, space structures, etc.
On top of that, the professors I was working with were my absolute favorites. So, that was another big reason for me choosing this project and working with them.

**Summary of Project**: A  computer program was developed that can give out the exact beam cross-sectional properties for nonlinear analysis. The theory based on which the program is developed is called MSG (Mechanics of Structure Genome) and uses the concept of SG (Structure Gene) to model composite thin-walled beam structures at multi-scales. Such kind of modeling is used to design long blade-like structures accurately. One can refer to "Mechanics of Structure Genome" by Prof Wenbin Yu (Purdue University) to read upon his works.
