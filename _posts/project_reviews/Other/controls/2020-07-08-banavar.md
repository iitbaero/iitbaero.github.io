# Cooperative Load Transportation using Helicopters
### Manav Vora
**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 7069773524

**Project type**: Summer Project

**Motivation to pursue project**: Wanted to explore the field of dynamics and controls and get acquainted with the basics.

**Summary of Project**: This was my first foray into controls. So through this project I was able to get my hands dirty just a bit. But was a great learning experience. With the help of this project, I learned all the basic concepts which are ubiquitous to controls like Rotational dynamics, Lie Algebra, Lagrangian Mechanics etc. I also performed my first ever simulation in dynamics and controls in this project. So this project basically helped me lay a foundation to build on.
