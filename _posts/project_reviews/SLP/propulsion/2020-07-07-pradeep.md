# Distortion Tolerant Fan Design for Boundary Layer Ingestion Systems
### Ronit Shukla
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 9923163770

---

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: I had developed quite an interest in turbomachines through the courses as AE223, AE234 and AE651. Hence I had to explore a bit more in this domain.

**Summary of Project**: The SLP was revolved around literature review of all the major sources of data and testing done in this particular field. Through the SLP, learnings about BLI fluid flow, redesigns required for smooth operations, etc were accomplished.

# Effect of blade surface abnormalities on compressor performance
### Avinash Arun
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 6379494121

---

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: My interest and curiosity in turbomachinery 

**Summary of Project**: The surface roughness/abnormalities of blades causes deteriorating effects on the compressor performance. The main aim of this project was to understand the performance parameters of compressors that are greatly effected by surface abnormalities. Through literature review we first look at the effects on airfoils, then study the blades with uniform and non uniform roughness distribution and finally study the reduction in performance parameters like pressure ratio, efficiency and mass flow in the compressor stage. Further we explore the benefits of compressor washing.
