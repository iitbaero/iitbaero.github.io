# Shock strength function in one-dimensional shock tube
### Mridul Agarwal
**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 8320107734

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: The first course in thermodynamics got me highly interested in the field, and I really like Prof Sinha's way of teaching. I always have the mindset that in order to properly understand whether or not you like something, you need to work on it for a considerable time (6-months atleast), with this in mind, I approached Krishnendu Sinha sir right after the end of my third semester and started working on this project.


**Summary of Project**: The shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction is complicated by the simultaneous presence of flow separation, stream-line curvature, and mean compression downstream of the shock.
 These equations are highly dependent on the flow Mach number and hence require near-precise values of the Mach number throughout the flow. This necessitates finding the Mach number along with the flow with the knowledge of only the boundary conditions. Realising that shocks are the primary source of change in Mach number, detecting the shocks in the flow and estimating their respective strength would serve the purpose.
 In my project, an attempt was made to test a pair of equations against a set of known cases and suitable changes to minimise the errors. The data obtained is validated by comparing it with theoretical results using analytical methods.
