# The Behavior of Inflated Isotropic Incompressible Hyper-elastic Toroidal Thin Membrane
### Goparaju Khushal
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 7400219319

---

**Project type**: SLP

**Motivation to pursue project**: My motivation to pursue the project was to get basic understanding on how to model and solve a problem using continuum approach.

**Summary of Project**: This SLP was focused on continuum modeling of the toroidal structure and obtaining the equations governing the deformation as it is inflated with pressure.

# Snap-through Instability in Inflated Isotropic Incompressible Hyper-elastic Toroidal Thin Membrane
### Goparaju Khushal

**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 7400219319

---

**Project type**: SLP

**Motivation to pursue project**: My motivation to pursue this project was to improve my understanding on thin structures and the instabilities which might cause failure of the structure, and also doing this project would help as prerequisite for further projects.

**Summary of Project**: This SLP was a continuation of my previous SLP and this focuses on the snap-through instability which occurs due to the bifurcation of equilibrium and softening of the structure. A study on how different constitutive relations predict the pressure vs deformation behavior and the snap-through pressure for the toroid was performed. Also a parametric study was performed by varying thickness, minor radius of the toroid.
