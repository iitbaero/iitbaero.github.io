# ML approaches for SMM behavior characterization
### Yash Chauhan
**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 8141130114

---

**Project type**: SLP

**Motivation to pursue project**: After my first SLP, I wanted build on my learning from the earlier SLP as well as gain experience in developing ML model for behaviour characterization of shape memory materials.

**Summary of Project**: Developed hybrid machine learning model to capture non-linear hysteresis behaviour of shape memory materials.

# Case Study on the eect of Deep Learning in the Determination of Composite Properties
### Ajith R
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 180010004@iitb.ac.in

---

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: Interested in a project in any of the sectors of Aerospace Engineering where I can apply artificial intelligence for analysis.

**Summary of Project**: The prime objective of this project is to get an overview of the application of Artificial Neural networks in the determination of mechanical properties in the composite structure
through analyzing by carrying out a case study. The rst case study determines the effect
of an artificial neural network in determining the mechanical properties of a composite material using a feed-forward propagation method. Furthermore, the second case study also
determines the Mechanical properties of a Composite using artificial neural networks but
here by Back Propagation and genetic algorithm.
