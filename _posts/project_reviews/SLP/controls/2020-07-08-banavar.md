# Geometric mechanics - dynamics of double pendulum
### Joy Patel
**Year of Study**: 3rd

**Contact details**: 9769210130

**Project type**: SLP

**Motivation to pursue project**: I was wanted to do some project related to aerospace controls, as I wanted to go for higher studies. And from some seniors and some research, I came to know that Prof. Banavar would be a good person to approach. So, I mailed him and he offered me one project but it wasn't related to aerospace but still I accepted it since this was my first project and I was still exploring the field of controls. And my damp mentor also told me that I shouldn't be so choosy in the beginning.

**Summary of Project**: It was a great experience. Prof. Ravi Banavar is very helpful to the extent that he made videos for some topics which were new to us. And another good were the weekly meets where we discussed not just about the project but also had informal talks.

Now, about my project, so in the beginning the problem statement was to control a double pendulum but I wasn't able to solve that in given time, I was just able to reach till finding the dynamics of the double pendulum. But in the process I learnt about non linear systems, geometric mechanics. And after the slp also, I continued to work with Prof. Banavar on another project.
