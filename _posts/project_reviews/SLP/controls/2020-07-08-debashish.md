# Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control Theory
### Mridul Agarwal
**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 8320107734

---

**Project type**: SLP.

**Motivation to pursue project**: After exploring various fields in my first & second years, I finally settled on controls. I had a good practical background on it owing to my work in team UMIC but I needed to expand my theoretical foundation. Professor DC is one of the best professors in the institute when it comes to this. He is extremely knowledgeable and has a very strong theoretical background, hence I chose him for doing my SLP.

**Summary of Project**: Optimal control theory is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. It has numerous applications in both science and engineering. Optimal control deals with finding a control law for a given system such that a particular optimality criterion is achieved.
My project was mainly based on the first four chapters from "Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control Theory - A Concise Introduction" by Daniel Liberzon. We used the theory learnt to solve Zermelo's river crossing problem.
