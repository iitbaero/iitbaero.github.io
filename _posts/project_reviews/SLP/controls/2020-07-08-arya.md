# Simulation and Control of Tethered Drones
### Manav Vora
**Year of Study**: 4th

**Contact details**: 7069773524

---

**Project type**: SLP

**Motivation to pursue project**: I’m pretty much interested in aerial robotics and am planning on pursuing masters in the same. So this project was a huge step in that direction.

**Summary of Project**: The aim of the project was to simulate the dynamics of a drone which was connected to a fixed point on the ground via a tether and then design a controller to make the drone perform certain manoeuvres in the air. The tether was modelled in a way to account for its flexibility . Currently I’m now working on an extension of this project which I’ll be tagging as my BTP.
