**Information about Projects/Assignments**: There were no assignments/projects at least till the midsems. Evaluation was based only on quizzes, midsems and endsems.


**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 3/5

**Overall Course Difficulty**: Moderate

**Average Time Commitment**:
(Apart from lectures and tutorials)
Between 3-6 hrs


**Attendance Policy**:

---

**General funda**: Practice problems and derivations with steps. Cheat sheets are allowed but subtle assumptions told during class are important for problem solving.


**Grading stats**: S grade was given.

**Professor's Teaching Style**: The professor gives very systematic and easy to understand notes. There are no slides, except for figures. It is almost complete in itself. Generally, cheat sheets are allowed by him so that we don't have to remember all the formulae. He is also very student-friendly.

**Should you do this course?**: Sophomores with a basic idea of the governing equations in fluid mechanics can take this course. Strongly recommended for those interested in Aerodynamics and even high-speed propulsion as the course forms the basis of it.
