# Autumn 2019
### Prof. PJ Guruprasad
**Author**: Sakshi Dayal

**Pre-requisite courses**: [AE 227](/course_reviews/second_year/ae-227), AE 238

**Pre-requisite skills**: Basic MATLAB coding. (Code template was given, you need to just complete missing sections according to the question)

**Course Content**:

- Basics of finite element method (for motivation)
- Standard discrete spring-mass-damper system
- Variational methods of approximation (derivations)
- Rayleigh- Ritz method and Method of Weighted Residuals
- Weak Forms of Finite Element Approximation
- 1D, 2D, 3D FEM models (bar, Euler-Bernoulli beam, Timoshenko beam)
- Reduced Numerical integration
- Introduction to finite element method in dynamics and vibrations
- Computer implementation of the finite element models

**Motivation to take up the course**: I had been using ANSYS and other simulation software mindlessly, but during my intern I realised we must know the background algorithms to avoid committing blunders. Also, FEM is an integral part of structures and if one is seeking to do projects or pursue career in this field, one will definitely require basic FEM knowledge.

**Information about Projects/Assignments**:

Two quizzes (10% each)

Assignments (10%)

Midsem (30%)

Endsem (40%)

This was declared in the beginning of the course, but changed drastically as semester proceeded. Weightage for assignments was increased and there was no midsem.
Assignments are given a week in advance and have deadline a day prior to quiz. Completing and understanding each concept covered in the assignment is beneficial for quiz preparation. Quizzes are quite straightforward, mostly based on tutorial problems covered in class. Endsem was of medium difficulty. Formulae are provided during exams, no need of memorizing, just knowing how to attempt and reduce the question is important. There is a lot of scope of doing silly mistakes, so make sure you complete the questions till the very end while practicing.


**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 2/5

**Overall Course Difficulty**: Moderate

**Average Time Commitment**:
(Apart from lectures and tutorials)
Less than 3 hrs


**Attendance Policy**: There was no attendance policy, but it is recommended to attend lectures (especially tutorials)

**General funda**: Attempt tutorial questions and assignments on your own, and till the very last step. Use a calculator and discover your own tricks to solve questions in less time and with more accuracy.


**Grading stats**:

| AA |  4 |
| AB |  16 |
| BB |  11 |
| BC and below | 14  |
| FR |  1 |

**Professor's Teaching Style**: Asking doubts personally from the professor helps a lot. Raise questions and ask to repeat if you don't understand some step. Reading and attempting derivations by oneself using lecture notes is helpful.

**Should you do this course?**: Anyone in third year or above can take this course. One should be comfortable with numerical methods, structure courses, and basic MATLAB coding.
Scoring 8-9 is easy if you follow the course regularly, a 10 needs extra efforts. But for the utility of the course content, I highly recommend taking up this course, you won't regret.
