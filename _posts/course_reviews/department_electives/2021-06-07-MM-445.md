**General Fundae**:
This is more concept and a bit of applied math course and from personal experience if we just pay attention in the lectures and get the doubts clarified immediately there will be no need of extra effort in the week apart from solving assignments.

**Feedback on Lectures**:
Awesome Professor in terms of content delivery, making it easy to understand and encourages doubts and discussions relevant to the lecture. 


**Should you do this course?**: 
People interested in structures or anyone who is curious to learn about plasticity.
