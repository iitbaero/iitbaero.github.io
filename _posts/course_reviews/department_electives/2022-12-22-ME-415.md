# Spring 2022
### Prof. Sandip Kumar Saha
**Author**: Vishnu Sankar

**Pre-requisite skills**: AE 225, Heat Transfer (not a hard prereq)

**Pre-requisite skills**: Basic fluids stuff and coding in any language (MATLAB/Python)

**Course Content**: Review of conservation equations, lumped parameter approach leading to non-linear equations, numerical solutions of non-linear equation. Concept of round off error, overflow, propagation of error. Problems leading to system of linear equations. Techniques for solving system of linear equations (direct and iterative). Scaling and nondimensionalisation. Linear and non linear regression techniques to correlate experimental data. Numerical Integration, calculation of shape factors. Thermal and fluid problems leading to ODE. Initial, Boundary and Eigen value problems. Solutions of ODE using marching and finite difference methods. Characterization of partial differential equations, Numerical solutions of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations encountered in heat transfer and fluid flow.

**Motivation to take up the course**: For people intrested in Computational fluids research , a basic CFD course is a must. And a CFD course covers most stuff required to progress forward.

**Information about Projects/Assignments**:
-Assignments x4 = 45%
-one quiz - 5%
-Midsem and endsem rest.

**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 3/5


**Assignments/Project Difficulty**: 3/5

**Info about Projects/Assignments**:
Assignemnts are based on examples related to the concepts covered like FEM, FDM, FVM. Coding in any language is a part of the assignment.

**General funda**: The assignments are lengthy so get started with them as soon as possible. The exams have a few questions similar to the ones in assignments, so solve your assignments diligently. A class of about an hour and a half is very tiresome for this course, try not to loose track of the lectures. 

**Professor's Teaching Style**: Very chill, the prof taught slowly but didnt miss out content. 

**References OR online resources**:
None

**Should you do this course?**: 
Whoever has interest in fluids or just wants to explore aero/mech. Suitable for 5th sem onwards.
