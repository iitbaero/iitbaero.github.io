**General funda**: Take notes during lecture and revise every single point said in the class. Nothing beyond lecture is asked in quizzes.
Quizzes seem easy, avoid silly mistakes. Don't overthink and go with your first intuition. Give graphs, explanation wherever applicable; don't miss out any point that you believe is related to the question in any manner. Write all the intermediate steps, because you won't be awarded marks if your final answer is wrong and intermediate calculations are missing.
