## The Department Academic Mentorship Program

__*What is DAMP?*__

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Department Academic Mentorship Program (DAMP) team, Aerospace Engineering, IITB consists of 19 exuberant and highly motivated students working towards providing the necessary help and guidance to all sophomores and under performing upperclassmen.

__*How can a DAMP mentor help you?*__
1. If you are a freshmen:
  * The DAMP team will be instrumental in conducting session to keep you informed of your options across the spectrum towards the end of your first year.
2. If you are a rising sophomore:
  * Your DAMP mentor will help ease your transition into department specific courses and activities
  * Your DAMP mentor would act as a guiding hand in resolving your academic and non-academic issues
3. If you are an upperclassman (third year and higher) who has been allotted a DAMP mentor:
  * Your DAMP mentor will help you overcome any difficulties and accelerate your academic performance

__*Our Vision:*__
> *Make Aerospace DAMP team a role model to the entire Institute for how effective academic mentorship is done.*

__*Our Goals:*__
* Reduce the number of students in ARP and/or with backlogs.
* Motivate students to perform better in academics as well as encourage them to excel in their other interests.
* Improve communication between the faculty and students.

## Initiatives by the 2019-20 team:
* Revamp the __Department Academic Volunteer Programme__ . This wing of the DAMP team focuses on conducting "Basics" and "Doubt Clearing" Academic Help Sessions for students.
* To conduct a Aerospace Faculty Research Presentation and Luncheon to improve student-faculty relations
* Continuing the highly-regarded novel approach to boosting Mathematical skills of under performing students through  **Math Help Sessions**.
* To discuss the possible reconstruction of curriculum and introduction of new courses/electives

## How to be a part of the team?
* Team Members are students from 3rd year and above. They are selected through a dynamic process of interviews and peer reviews.
* What we look for? - Students who are motivated in helping others and will be dedicated to do so.
