The beginning of
the 20th century, the world saw the birth of an engineering discipline which rapidly
expanded itâ€™s wings over the years. Indeed, Aerospace
Engineering gave wings to our desire to fly, put man on the moon, and took us
faster than the speed of sound.

Aerospace engineering is a diverse and rapidly changing field which includes
four major subdomains:

* Aerodynamics
* Dynamics and Control
* Propulsion, and
* Structures and Materials.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The primary application of aerospace engineering is
the design and development of aircraft, missiles and spacecraft. However,
it may also be applied to other vehicles and systems such
as submarines, automobiles, trains, trucks, buses and rapid transit.
